## Current Test Status

### ✅ Working Test Suites
- Component unit tests (new)
- Utility function tests
- Value object tests
- Basic service tests

### ⚠️ Problematic Test Suites
- Market Data Integration tests (provider implementation issues)
- Transaction Flow integration tests (service mocking issues)
- E2E tests (need setup improvements)

### 🔧 Recent Improvements
- Enhanced test setup with better mocking
- Optimized test configuration for stability
- Created integration tests for transaction flows
- Added timeout and retry configurations

### 📋 Next Steps
1. Fix market data provider implementation
2. Improve service mocking strategy
3. Implement proper E2E test environment
4. Add visual regression testing
5. Set up CI/CD test pipeline

### 🎯 Test Goals
- Target: 80%+ test coverage
- Current: Partial coverage with stable foundation
- Focus: Component reliability and integration flows
