# ðŸ”§ Strategy Step 6 Bug Fixes

## Issues Fixed

### **1. Fee Breakdown Values Showing $0.00** âœ… FIXED

**Problem:** Fee breakdown in Step 6 was showing $0.00 for individual fees (diBoaS Fee, Network Fee, DEX Fee) while only the total showed a value.

**Root Cause:** Mismatch between fee calculator response structure and the `sanitizeFeeBreakdown` utility function expectations.

**Solution:** Enhanced `sanitizeFeeBreakdown` in `/src/utils/numberFormatting.js` to handle multiple fee structure formats:

```javascript
// Enhanced to handle both old and new fee calculator structures
sanitized.breakdown = {
  diboas: safeToNumber(feeBreakdown.breakdown.diboas || feeBreakdown.breakdown.diBoaS?.amount || feeBreakdown.diBoaS, 0),
  network: safeToNumber(feeBreakdown.breakdown.network?.amount || feeBreakdown.breakdown.network || feeBreakdown.network, 0),
  dex: safeToNumber(feeBreakdown.breakdown.dex?.amount || feeBreakdown.breakdown.dex || feeBreakdown.dex, 0),
  provider: safeToNumber(feeBreakdown.breakdown.provider?.amount || feeBreakdown.breakdown.provider || feeBreakdown.provider, 0),
  defi: safeToNumber(feeBreakdown.breakdown.defi?.amount || feeBreakdown.breakdown.defi || feeBreakdown.defi, 0)
}
```

**Result:** Fee breakdown now correctly displays individual fee values like:
- diBoaS Fee (0.09%): $0.90
- Network Fee (0.01%): $0.10  
- DEX Fee (0.5%): $5.00

### **2. Network Fee Missing Chain Percentage** âœ… FIXED

**Problem:** Network Fee was displaying without percentage because chain information wasn't available to determine the fee rate.

**Solution:** 
1. **Added chain information to strategy templates:**
```javascript
const STRATEGY_TEMPLATES = {
  'free-coffee': {
    // ... existing fields
    chain: 'ETH',
    protocol: 'Aave', 
    asset: 'USDC'
  },
  'emergency-fund': {
    // ... existing fields
    chain: 'SOL',
    protocol: 'Solend',
    asset: 'USDC'
  }
  // ... other templates with chain info
}
```

2. **Updated fee calculation to use template chain:**
```javascript
// Get chain and asset from template if available
const strategyChain = template?.chain || 'SOL'
const strategyAsset = template?.asset || 'USDC'

const fees = await calculateFees({
  type: 'start_strategy',
  amount: safeAmount,
  asset: strategyAsset,
  paymentMethod: 'diboas_wallet',
  chains: [strategyChain]
})
```

3. **Added helper function for chain-specific percentages:**
```javascript
const getNetworkFeePercentage = (chain) => {
  const networkFeeRates = {
    'SOL': '0.01%',
    'ETH': '0.02%', 
    'BTC': '0.05%',
    'SUI': '0.01%'
  }
  return networkFeeRates[chain] || '0.01%'
}
```

4. **Updated UI to show percentage:**
```javascript
<span>Network Fee ({getNetworkFeePercentage(wizardData.feeBreakdown.chain)}):</span>
```

**Result:** Network Fee now displays with chain-specific percentage:
- For SOL strategies: "Network Fee (0.01%): $0.10"
- For ETH strategies: "Network Fee (0.02%): $0.20"
- For BTC strategies: "Network Fee (0.05%): $0.50"

### **3. Total Cost Balance Deduction Incorrect** âœ… FIXED

**Problem:** Balance deduction was only subtracting the investment amount instead of the total cost (investment amount + fees).

**Root Cause:** Transaction data was using `safeInitialAmount` instead of `totalCost` for the amount field.

**Solution:** Updated transaction data creation in strategy launch:

```javascript
// Calculate total cost (amount + fees) for proper balance deduction
const totalFees = safeToNumber(wizardData.feeBreakdown?.total, 0)
const totalCost = safeInitialAmount + totalFees

const transactionData = {
  ...safeResult.transaction,
  type: 'start_strategy',
  amount: totalCost, // Use total cost for balance deduction
  investmentAmount: safeInitialAmount, // Keep track of actual investment
  fees: wizardData.feeBreakdown || safeResult.transaction.fees,
  paymentMethod: 'diboas_wallet',
  // ... other fields
}
```

**Balance Update Logic (already correct in DataManager):**
- **Available Balance** = current - `totalCost` (investment + fees)
- **Strategy Balance** = current + `netInvestment` (investment amount only)
- **Invested Balance** = no changes

**Example:**
- Investment Amount: $1,000
- Total Fees: $60
- Total Cost: $1,060
- Available Balance: $2,000 â†’ $940 (reduced by $1,060)
- Strategy Balance: $0 â†’ $1,000 (increased by net investment)

## Files Modified

### **1. `/src/utils/numberFormatting.js`**
- Enhanced `sanitizeFeeBreakdown()` to handle multiple fee structure formats
- Added fallback logic for legacy and new fee calculator responses

### **2. `/src/components/yield/StrategyConfigurationWizard.jsx`**
- Added chain, protocol, and asset information to `STRATEGY_TEMPLATES`
- Updated fee calculation to use template-specific chain and asset
- Added `getNetworkFeePercentage()` helper function
- Enhanced fee breakdown display to show network fee percentage
- Fixed transaction data to use total cost for balance deduction
- Added chain information to fee breakdown data structure

## Testing

Created comprehensive test suite in `/src/test/fixes/strategy-step6-fixes.test.jsx`:

### **Test Coverage:**
- âœ… Fee breakdown value extraction from multiple response formats
- âœ… Legacy fee structure fallback handling  
- âœ… Invalid input safety and defaults
- âœ… Chain-specific network fee percentages
- âœ… Strategy template chain information
- âœ… Total cost calculation accuracy
- âœ… Transaction data structure correctness
- âœ… Balance update simulation
- âœ… Complete integration flow testing

### **Test Results:**
```
âœ… Strategy Step 6 Fixes: 9/9 PASSED (100%)
âœ… All original tests: 14/14 PASSED (100%)
âœ… Total test coverage: 23/23 PASSED (100%)
```

## Impact

### **User Experience Improvements:**
1. **Transparent Fees:** Users can now see exact fee amounts for each component
2. **Chain Clarity:** Network fees show chain-specific percentages for better understanding  
3. **Accurate Balances:** Total cost (including fees) is properly deducted from available balance
4. **Trust & Transparency:** Complete fee breakdown builds user confidence

### **System Reliability:**
1. **Data Consistency:** Proper fee structure handling prevents display errors
2. **Financial Accuracy:** Correct balance calculations maintain system integrity
3. **Extensible Design:** Support for multiple chains and fee structures
4. **Error Prevention:** Robust fallback mechanisms for edge cases

## Next Steps

### **âœ… Completed:**
- All three bugs fixed and tested
- Comprehensive test coverage added
- Chain information integrated into strategy templates
- Balance deduction logic corrected

### **ðŸ”„ Recommendations for Future:**
1. **Real Chain Integration:** Replace mock chain data with actual DeFi provider chain information
2. **Dynamic Fee Rates:** Consider making network fee rates configurable by chain
3. **Fee Optimization:** Add fee comparison across different chains for user optimization
4. **Performance Monitoring:** Track fee calculation performance as more chains are added

## Summary

All three Strategy Step 6 bugs have been successfully resolved:

âœ… **Fee Breakdown Values**: Individual fees now display correct amounts  
âœ… **Network Fee Percentage**: Chain-specific percentages now shown  
âœ… **Total Cost Balance**: Correct amount (investment + fees) deducted from available balance

The system now provides a transparent, accurate, and user-friendly fee breakdown experience that properly handles balance calculations across multiple blockchain networks.
