# Asset Navigation Data Persistence Fix - Test Results

## ✅ **ISSUE RESOLVED**

### **Problem:**
Users were losing all their balance data and transaction history when navigating to asset detail pages (e.g., `/asset/BTC`).

### **Root Cause:**
App.jsx initialization logic was incorrectly calling `resetToCleanState()` whenever the `isCleanState()` function returned false, which happened every time users had legitimate transaction data.

### **Solution Applied:**
1. **Fixed App.jsx**: Updated initialization logic to only reset data when it's actually corrupted (null/undefined values)
2. **Smart Validation**: Now preserves real user data while still cleaning up corrupted data
3. **Added Tests**: Created comprehensive tests to prevent regression

### **Test Scenarios:**

#### **Before Fix:**
1. User performs "Add $1000" transaction ✅
2. Balance shows $1000 ✅  
3. User navigates to `/asset/BTC` ❌
4. **BUG**: Balance resets to $0, transaction history cleared ❌

#### **After Fix:**
1. User performs "Add $1000" transaction ✅
2. Balance shows $1000 ✅
3. User navigates to `/asset/BTC` ✅
4. **FIXED**: Balance still shows $1000, transaction history preserved ✅
5. User navigates back to dashboard ✅
6. **FIXED**: All data remains intact ✅

### **Manual Testing Instructions:**

1. **Start Clean**: Open http://localhost:5173/
2. **Add Funds**: Go to Banking → Add → Add $500 (complete transaction)
3. **Verify Balance**: Dashboard should show $500 total
4. **Navigate to Asset**: Go to Investment → Click any asset (e.g., BTC)
5. **Check Data**: Balance should still show $500 (not reset to $0)
6. **Navigate Back**: Go back to dashboard 
7. **Verify Persistence**: Balance and transaction history should be intact

### **Files Modified:**
- `src/App.jsx` - Fixed initialization logic
- `src/components/__tests__/AssetDetailPage.navigation.simple.test.jsx` - Added tests

### **Test Coverage:**
✅ Balance data preservation during asset navigation
✅ Transaction history preservation during asset navigation  
✅ User holdings display on asset pages
✅ No inappropriate data resets

The asset navigation now works correctly while preserving all user financial data! 🎉
